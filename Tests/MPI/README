For installing MPI you will need to do the following:

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev

On other Ubuntu installations you will also have to do:

$ sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin          # Already on the VM

You should then be able to do the following:

$ mpif90 test1.f90
$ mpiexec -n 4 a.out
